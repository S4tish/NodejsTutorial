// The Node.js assert os the most elementary way to write tests. It provides no feedback when running 
// your test unless one fails.The assert module provides a simple set of assertion test that can be
// used to test invariants .the module is intended for internal use by Node.js but can be used in 
// application code via require

// However assert is not a testing framework and cannot be used as general purpose assertion library
